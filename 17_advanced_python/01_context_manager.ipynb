    "# context manager protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "A context manager in Python is a way to allocate and release resources precisely when you want to. The most common example is using a `with` block to manage resources like files, sockets, or locks. It ensures:\n",
    "- Proper acquisition and release of resources.\n",
    "- Clean, readable, and error-safe code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîß Built-in Example using with:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Opens file and assigns to f.\n",
    "# Automatically closes the file after the block (even if an error occurs).\n",
    "with open('demo.txt', 'w') as f:\n",
    "  f.write('Hello, world!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ú® Custom Context Manager using Class:\n",
    "To create a custom context manager, your class must implement two special methods that support the context management protocol:\n",
    "- `__enter__(self)`\n",
    "- `__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ __enter__ Method\n",
    "- Called at the beginning of the with block.\n",
    "- Used to set up any required resources.\n",
    "- It can return any object, which will be assigned to the variable after as in the with statement.\n",
    "- If you don‚Äôt need to return anything specific, simply return self or None.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ __exit__ Method\n",
    "- This method is automatically invoked at the end of the with block, regardless of whether the block exited normally or due to an exception.\n",
    "- üîç Parameters:\n",
    "    - exc_type\tThe type of exception raised (e.g., ZeroDivisionError)\n",
    "    - exc_val\tThe actual exception object (e.g., ZeroDivisionError('div by zero'))\n",
    "    - exc_tb\tA traceback object (includes file name, line number, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚úÖ Responsibilities of __exit__**\n",
    "- Perform cleanup (e.g., close files, release locks).\n",
    "- Handle any exceptions that occurred in the with block.\n",
    "-Optionally suppress exceptions based on the return value.\n",
    "  - üîÅ If __exit__ Returns:\n",
    "    - **True**: The exception is suppressed, and program execution continues.\n",
    "    - **False** or **None**: The exception is re-raised after the block exits."
