    "**pass is a null statement. It literally does nothing when it's executed.**\n",
    "Its main purpose is to act as a placeholder where the Python syntax requires a statement, but you don't want any code to run. This is useful in several situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Empty Functions/Classes:** When you're designing the structure of your code and want to define a function or class but haven't written the implementation yet, you can use pass to make it syntactically valid:\n",

    "```\n",

    "- **Conditional Statements/Loops:** If you have an if, elif, else, for, or while block where you need to handle a specific condition but don't want to perform any action for it:\n",

    "```Python\n",
    "value = 10\n",
    "if value > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"Greater than 5\")\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Less than 5\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "- **Exception Handling:** Sometimes you might want to catch a specific exception but intentionally ignore it (use this carefully, as ignoring errors can hide problems):\n",
