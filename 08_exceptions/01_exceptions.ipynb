    "# Python Exceptions\n",
    "There are (at least) two distinguishable kinds of errors: **syntax errors and exceptions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program, disrupting the normal flow. If not handled, they cause the program to terminate abruptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exception Hierarchy:**\n",
    "- **BaseException** is the common base class of all built-in exceptions.\n",
    "- One of its subclasses, **Exception, is the base class of all non-fatal exceptions.** These are the exceptions your programs will typically handle.\n",
    "- Exceptions which are not subclasses of Exception (like `SystemExit` raised by `sys.exit()` or `KeyboardInterrupt` raised when the user presses `Ctrl+C`) are generally not caught because they usually indicate the program should terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's a simplified view of some common exceptions derived from Exception:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BaseException**\n",
    "  - **Exception**\n",
    "    - **ArithmeticError**\n",
    "      - ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "      - FloatingPointError\n",
    "    - **LookupError**\n",
    "      - IndexError *(Sequence index out of range)*\n",
    "      - KeyError *(Mapping key not found)*\n",
    "    - **NameError**\n",
    "      - UnboundLocalError *(Local variable referenced before assignment)*\n",
    "    - TypeError *(Operation on inappropriate type)*\n",
    "    - ValueError *(Right type, but inappropriate value)*\n",
    "    - RuntimeError *(Errors that don't fall in other categories)*\n",
    "    - **OSError**\n",
    "      - PermissionError\n",
    "      - FileNotFoundError\n",
    "    - ExceptionGroup *(Represents a group of unrelated exceptions)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective exception handling is crucial for writing robust and user-friendly applications. It allows you to:\n",
    "- **Prevent Crashes:** Gracefully manage errors derived from Exception instead of letting the program stop.\n",
    "- **Handle Errors:** Provide specific responses to different types of errors (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`).\n",
    "- **Clean Up Resources:** Ensure that necessary cleanup actions (like closing files or network connections) are performed, even if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore Python's mechanism for handling exceptions using the try, except, else, and finally blocks. We'll see how to catch specific exceptions and perform appropriate actions when errors arise."
