    "## Data Types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a versatile language that supports a wide range of data types. Understanding these types is crucial for effective programming. Here's an overview of the fundamental data types in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Numeric Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric types represent numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1.1 `int` (Integer):** Represents whole numbers without any fractional part.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Example: `10`, `-5`, `10000`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1.2 `float` (Floating-point):** Represents numbers with a decimal point, including fractional values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Example: `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.5`, `22/7`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1.3 `complex` (Complex Number):** Represents numbers with a real and an imaginary part, expressed in the form `a + bj`, where `a` is the real part, `b` is the imaginary part, and `j` is the imaginary unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Example: `3 + 4j`, `2 - 1j`\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Sequence Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence types represent ordered collections of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2.1 `str` (String):** Represents an immutable sequence of characters. Strings are used to store text.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Example: `\"Hello\"`, `'Python'`, `\"\"\"This is a multi-line string\"\"\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2.2 `list` (List):** Represents a mutable, ordered sequence of items. Lists can contain items of different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Example: `[1, 2, 3]`, `['a', 'b', 'c']`, `[1, 2.0, 'three', True]`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2.3 `tuple` (Tuple):** Represents an immutable, ordered sequence of items. Tuples are similar to lists but cannot be modified after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Example: `(1, 2, 3)`, `('a', 'b', 'c')`, `(1, 2.0, True)`\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Note: A tuple with a single element requires a trailing comma: `(1,)`. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a regular value in parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2.4 `range` (Range):** Represents an immutable sequence of numbers, typically used for looping.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Example: `range(5)` (generates numbers from 0 to 4), `range(2, 10)` (generates numbers from 2 to 9), `range(0, 10, 2)` (generates even numbers from 0 to 8)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Set Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Set types represent unordered collections of unique items.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **3.1 `set` (Set):** Represents a mutable, unordered collection of unique items. Sets do not allow duplicate elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Example: `{1, 2, 3}`, `{'a', 'b', 'c'}`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`frozenset`** (Immutable Set): Represents an immutable, unordered collection of unique items.  Similar to a set, but it cannot be changed after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Example: `frozenset([1, 2, 3])`\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Mapping Type**\n",
    "\n",
    "Mapping types represent key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **4.1 `dict` (Dictionary):** Represents a mutable collection of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable, while values can be of any type.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Example: `{'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}`\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Boolean Type**\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean types represent truth values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **5.1 `bool` (Boolean):** Represents either `True` or `False`. Boolean values are often used in conditional statements and logical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Binary Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary types represent sequences of bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **6.1 `bytes` (Immutable Byte Sequence):** Represents an immutable sequence of bytes (integers in the range 0-255).  Used for handling binary data, such as data from files or network sockets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Example: `b'hello'`, `bytes([65, 66, 67])`\n",
    "\n",
