    "## Detailed (can be skipped)\n",
    "### What is `__pycache__` in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "`__pycache__` is a directory where Python stores **compiled bytecode** files (`.pyc`) for faster script execution. This is done to improve performance by avoiding recompilation of Python files on each run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does it Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bytecode Compilation**:\n",
    "   - Python compiles `.py` files into bytecode, which is a lower-level, platform-independent format.\n",
    "   - The compiled bytecode is saved as `.pyc` files inside the `__pycache__` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Naming Convention**:\n",
    "   - `.pyc` files are named with a convention that includes the Python version. For example, `script.py` compiled with Python 3.9 would result in `script.cpython-39.pyc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it Useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster Execution**: Python can skip the compilation step by using `.pyc` files, leading to faster startup times.\n",
    "- **Avoid Recompiling**: Avoids recompiling unchanged scripts.\n",
    "- **Platform Independence**: The `.pyc` files are platform-independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "After running `script.py`, Python generates `__pycache__/script.cpython-39.pyc` to speed up subsequent executions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When is `__pycache__` Generated?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **On Import**: Python creates `.pyc` files in `__pycache__` when modules are imported.\n",
    "- **On Execution**: When running a script directly, Python generates the `.pyc` file for that script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing `__pycache__`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deleting `__pycache__`**: Deleting it will cause Python to regenerate the files when needed.\n",
    "- **Disabling Bytecode Generation**: You can prevent the creation of `.pyc` files with the `-B` flag:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  python -B script.py\n"
