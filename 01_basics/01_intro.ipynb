    "## Introduction to Python Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a **high-level**, **interpreted**, and **general-purpose** programming language. It is widely used due to its versatility, simplicity, and readability. Python provides powerful tools for solving problems, building applications, and automating tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python?\n",
    "- **Simple Syntax**: Python has a clean, readable syntax that makes it easy for new programmers to pick up.\n",
    "- **Versatile**: You can use Python for various tasks, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and more.\n",
    "- **Large Community**: Python has a large and supportive community, ensuring that you'll always find resources, libraries, and help.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Python:\n",
    "- **High-Level Language**: Python abstracts away complex details of computer operations, allowing you to focus more on solving problems than on managing memory or dealing with lower-level operations.\n",
    "- **Interpreted Language**: Python is an interpreted language, meaning that code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging easier and speeds up development.\n",
    "- **Dynamically Typed**: No need to declare the type of a variable, Python handles types automatically.\n",
    "- **Strongly Typed**: Python is a strongly typed language, meaning variable types are enforced during operations. Even though you don't declare types explicitly, Python ensures type consistency at runtime. For example, you can't concatenate a string with an integer without converting the integer to a string, or it will raise a TypeError.\n",
    "- **Object-Oriented**: Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP), allowing you to create reusable and modular code.\n",

    "### What is Python Interpreter Mode?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The interactive Python interpreter, also known as the Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), allows you to enter Python code line by line and immediately see the results. It is a great tool for experimenting, testing small code snippets, and learning Python interactively.\n",
    "* When you enter the interpreter mode, Python evaluates each expression you type and displays the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Entering Python Interpreter Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the Python interpreter, you can simply type one of the following commands in your terminal or command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python\n",
    "## or py also will work in windows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once entered, you will see a prompt like >>>, where you can start typing and executing Python code interactively.\n",
    "* **Example**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    >>> print(\"Hello, Python!\")\n",
    "    Hello, Python!\n",
    "    >>> 3 + 4 \n",
