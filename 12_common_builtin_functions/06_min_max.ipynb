    "### üìù Theory: `min()` and `max()` Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `min()` and `max()` functions are used to find the smallest and largest elements in an iterable, respectively. These functions are widely used with sequences such as lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "min(iterable, key=None, default=None)\n",
    "max(iterable, key=None, default=None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- iterable: The iterable (e.g., list, tuple, dictionary) whose elements will be compared.\n",
    "- key: (Optional) A function that serves as a key for comparison. If not provided, the elements themselves are compared.\n",
    "- default: (Optional) A value to return if the iterable is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "##### How It Works:\n",
    "**With Sequences:**\n",
    "- When applied to sequences like lists, tuples, and strings, min() and max() compare the elements directly, returning the smallest or largest one based on the natural ordering of the elements (e.g., numbers are compared numerically, and strings are compared lexicographically).\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Dictionaries:**\n",
    "- By default, min() and max() work on the keys of a dictionary. If you want to compare the values instead, you can use the key argument. \n",
    "- To compare based on values, explicitly mention `key = my_dict.get`\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Tuples:**\n",
    "- Tuple comparisons are lexicographical.\n",
    "- Python compares element by element in order, stopping once a difference is found.\n",
    "- For tuples of different lengths, the shorter tuple is considered smaller if all earlier elements are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---"
