    "\n",
    "Here's why it's used:\n",
    "- **Default Return Value:** Functions that don't explicitly use a `return` statement to send back a value automatically return `None`. You saw this in the example code with `print(fn1())`.\n",
    "- **Optional Arguments:** It's often used as a default value for function arguments when you want to signify that the argument wasn't provided by the caller. The function can then check `if argument is None:` to see if a value was passed.\n",
    "- **Placeholders:** Sometimes `None` is used to initialize a variable before it's assigned a meaningful value later in the code.\n",
    "- **Signaling Absence:** It's commonly used to indicate that a value isn't present or a condition hasn't been met, distinct from values like `0`, `False`, or an empty string (`\"\"`), which might be valid data in some contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Essentially, `None` provides a clear and unambiguous way to represent \"no value.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## pass\n",
    "**pass is a null statement. It literally does nothing when it's executed.**\n",
    "Its main purpose is to act as a placeholder where the Python syntax requires a statement, but you don't want any code to run. This is useful in several situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Empty Functions/Classes:** When you're designing the structure of your code and want to define a function or class but haven't written the implementation yet, you can use pass to make it syntactically valid:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_future_function():\n",
    "    pass # TODO: Implement this later\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyEmptyClass:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conditional Statements/Loops:** If you have an if, elif, else, for, or while block where you need to handle a specific condition but don't want to perform any action for it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "value = 10\n",
    "if value > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"Greater than 5\")\n",
    "elif value == 5:\n",
    "    pass # Do nothing if value is exactly 5\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Less than 5\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exception Handling:** Sometimes you might want to catch a specific exception but intentionally ignore it (use this carefully, as ignoring errors can hide problems):\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "try:\n",

    "except SomeSpecificError:\n",
