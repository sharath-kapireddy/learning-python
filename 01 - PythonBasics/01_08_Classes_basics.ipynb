    "# Introduction: Python Classes (Object-Oriented Programming)\n",
    "This notebook introduces the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python using classes. Classes serve as blueprints for creating objects, which bundle data (attributes) and functionality (methods) together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore key OOP concepts:\n",
    "- **Class Definition:** How to define a basic class using the class keyword.\n",
    "- **Constructor (__init__)**: Initializing object attributes when an instance is created.\n",
    "- **Instance Methods**: Functions defined within a class that operate on object instances (self).\n",
    "- **Attributes**: Variables associated with a class or an instance.\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes (child/subclass) that inherit properties and methods from existing classes (parent/superclass).\n",
    "- **super() Function**: Calling methods from the parent class within a child class, often used in __init__ and overridden methods."
