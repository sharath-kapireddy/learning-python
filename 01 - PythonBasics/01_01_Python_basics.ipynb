    "## Understanding Python and its Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides a concise overview of essential Python commands and concepts for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checking Python Version:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To check the installed Python version, you can use either of the following commands in your command line or terminal:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    python --version\n",
    "    py --version\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    The `python` command is commonly used, while `py` is a Windows-specific launcher that can be helpful if you have multiple Python versions installed.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Python as an Interpreted Language:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python, similar to JavaScript, is an **interpreted language**. This means that the code is executed line by line by an interpreter, without the need for a separate compilation step into machine code before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Interpreter Mode:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To enter the interactive Python interpreter directly in your command line or terminal, simply type:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    python\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    or\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    You will see a prompt (usually `>>>`) where you can type and execute Python code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exiting Interpreter Mode:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To exit the interactive Python interpreter and return to your command line or terminal, type the following and press Enter:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    exit()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Alternatively, you can often use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Z` (on Windows) or `Ctrl + D` (on macOS and Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "**pip: Python Package Installer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **pip** is the standard **package installer for Python**. It allows you to easily install, upgrade, and manage third-party libraries and dependencies that extend Python's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checking pip Version:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To check the installed version of pip, use the following command:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    pip --version\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    The output will typically show the pip version and the Python installation it is associated with, for example:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip 24.3.1 from C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python313\\Lib\\site-packages\\pip (python 3.13)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**JupyterLab: Interactive Development Environment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **JupyterLab** is a web-based interactive development environment for working with **Jupyter Notebooks** (files with the `.ipynb` extension). These notebooks can contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text, making them ideal for data analysis, scientific computing, and educational purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installing JupyterLab:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To install JupyterLab, you can use pip with the following command:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    pip install jupyterlab\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This command will download and install JupyterLab and its dependencies. Once installed, you can typically launch it from your command line using the command `jupyter lab`.\n"
