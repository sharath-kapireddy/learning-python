    "## Understanding Python and its Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides a concise overview of essential Python commands and concepts for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checking Python Version:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To check the installed Python version, you can use either of the following commands in your command line or terminal:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    python --version\n",
    "    py --version\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    The `python` command is commonly used, while `py` is a Windows-specific launcher that can be helpful if you have multiple Python versions installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python is a strongly typed language**\n",
    "- It's important to note that Python is a **strongly typed language**, meaning that variables do have a type, and the type matters during operations.  \n",
    "- Even though you don't have to explicitly declare the type of a variable before using it, **Python will enforce type consistency at runtime, preventing unexpected behavior.**\n",
    "\n",
    " **Python as an Interpreted Language:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python, similar to JavaScript, is an **interpreted language**. This means that the code is executed line by line by an interpreter, without the need for a separate compilation step into machine code before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Interpreter Mode:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To enter the interactive Python interpreter directly in your command line or terminal, simply type:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    python\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    or\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    You will see a prompt (usually `>>>`) where you can type and execute Python code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exiting Interpreter Mode:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To exit the interactive Python interpreter and return to your command line or terminal, type the following and press Enter:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    exit()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Alternatively, you can often use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Z` (on Windows) or `Ctrl + D` (on macOS and Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "**pip: Python Package Installer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **pip** is the standard **package installer for Python**. It allows you to easily install, upgrade, and manage third-party libraries and dependencies that extend Python's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checking pip Version:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To check the installed version of pip, use the following command:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    pip --version\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    The output will typically show the pip version and the Python installation it is associated with, for example:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip 24.3.1 from C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python313\\Lib\\site-packages\\pip (python 3.13)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**JupyterLab: Interactive Development Environment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **JupyterLab** is a web-based interactive development environment for working with **Jupyter Notebooks** (files with the `.ipynb` extension). These notebooks can contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text, making them ideal for data analysis, scientific computing, and educational purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installing JupyterLab:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To install JupyterLab, you can use pip with the following command:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    pip install jupyterlab\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This command will download and install JupyterLab and its dependencies. Once installed, you can typically launch it from your command line using the command `jupyter lab`.\n"

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Java's `public static void main(String[] args)`, Python doesn't automatically execute a function named main when a script starts. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block serves a crucial purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Script Execution:* When you run a Python file directly (e.g., python my_script.py), the special built-in variable `__name__` is set to the string `\"__main__\"`. Therefore, the condition `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` evaluates to `True`, and the code inside this block (in this case, calling the main1() function) is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Module Import:* However, if this Python file is imported as a module into another Python script (e.g., import my_script), the `__name__` variable in the imported module is set to the name of the module (e.g., \"my_script\"). In this scenario, the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` condition becomes `False`, and the code inside this block is not executed automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In essence, this construct ensures that the `main1()` function (or any code within this block) runs only when the script is executed directly, and not when it's imported as a reusable component (module) in another program. *"

    "#### For Jupyter Notebook Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *No `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` Needed:* In a Jupyter Notebook, each cell is essentially executed in the global scope of the notebook's kernel. The concept of a script being run as the \"main\" program versus being imported as a module doesn't apply in the same way. When you run a cell, the code within it is executed directly. Therefore, the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is unnecessary for simple execution within a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Direct Function Call:* So, you simply need to call the hello_world_notebook() function directly in a notebook cell. When you execute that cell, the code inside the function will run sequentially."
