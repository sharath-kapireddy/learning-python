    "- Standard library module in Python (since Python 2.6)\n",
    "- Enables true parallelism using multiple processes\n",
    "- Bypasses Python‚Äôs GIL, making it ideal for CPU-bound tasks\n",
    "- Comes with tools like:\n",
    "    - `Process`, `Queue`, `Pool`, `Pipe`, `Manager`\n",
    "\n",
    "**üî∏ multiprocess (üîÅ Third-party package)**\n",
    "- An external library (install via pip install multiprocess)\n",
    "- A fork of multiprocessing, developed by the pathos team\n",
    "- Supports more advanced serialization using dill instead of pickle\n",
    "- Meaning: it can handle closures, lambdas, and more complex objects\n",
    "- API is almost identical to multiprocessing\n",

    "**‚úÖ Important Points**\n",
    "- Each process in multiprocessing runs in its own memory space, so regular Python objects like dict aren't shared across processes.\n",
    "    - ‚úÖ To share data, use Manager().dict() ‚Äî a shared dictionary proxy accessible by all child processes.\n",
    "-‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid running multiprocessing code in interactive environments (like IDLE, Jupyter, or REPLs), as it may behave unexpectedly.\n",
    "    - ‚úÖ Prefer running your multiprocessing code as a standalone script (.py file) via terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "- üîÅ Common Pitfall:\n",
    "    - Always wrap multiprocessing code inside the if __name__ == \"__main__\": guard.\n",
    "    - ‚ùå Missing this on Windows/macOS can lead to unexpected behavior or infinite process spawning.\n",
    "- üß™ In notebooks, the built-in multiprocessing module may not function as expected.\n",
    "    - ‚úÖ To work around this, use the multiprocess package instead.\n",
    "    - ‚úÖ If running the same code as a script, you can safely switch back to:\n",
    "    - `from multiprocessing import Process, Manager`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Manager()?\n",
    "- Manager() is a special helper in the multiprocessing module that allows you to create shared objects like: dict, list, Namespace, Lock, Queue, etc.\n",
    "- These shared objects can be safely accessed and modified across multiple processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üîß Why do you need it?**\n",
    "- In multithreading, threads share memory. But in multiprocessing, each process has its own memory space. So, if you do this: `result = {}`\n",
    "and then pass it to two Processes ‚Äî it won‚Äôt work. Each process gets a copy, not the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To fix that, you use:\n",
    "    -   ```python\n",
    "        from multiprocessing import Manager\n",
    "        result = Manager().dict()\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "- Now result is a proxy object, backed by a server process that all child processes can talk to safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üîÅ Behind the Scenes**\n",
    "- Manager() spawns a server process internally.\n",
    "- When you use manager.dict() or manager.list(), it returns proxy objects.\n",
    "- These proxies handle inter-process communication (IPC) and synchronize access."
