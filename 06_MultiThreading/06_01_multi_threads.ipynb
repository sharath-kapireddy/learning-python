    "# Multithreading Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading allows a program to run multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently. It's useful when you have tasks that can run independently, especially I/O-bound operations (like file reads/writes, API calls).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python and the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)**\n",
    "- Python (specifically CPython) has a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time.\n",
    "- This means multithreading in Python is not suitable for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., heavy calculations).\n",
    "- But it's great for I/O-bound tasks â€” like downloading files, reading from databases, or waiting for user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**âœ… Use it for:**\n",
    "- File I/O operations\n",
    "- Network requests\n",
    "- Delayed response systems (e.g., sleep, user wait)\n",
    "\n",
    "**ðŸš« Avoid it for:**\n",
    "- CPU-intensive tasks â€” use multiprocessing instead\n",
